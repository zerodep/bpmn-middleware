- introduce new optional `basePath` option to control middleware endpoint base path

## [0.17.0] - 2025-01-22

Playing around with custom adapters requiring specials options per engine revealed some problems. An attempt to solve just that.

- forward query parameters as resume options when calling `(*)?/status/:token/:activityId`
- add ability to clone current `res.locals.engines` with override options to facilitate passing custom adapter per engine

## [0.16.1] - 2025-01-10

- `DELETE (*)?/state/:token` forwards body to adapter delete as options

## [0.16.0] - 2025-01-08

- run/resume/signal engine in sync, i.e. run until end and return output as result

## [0.10.0] - 2024-11-14

- take `autosaveEngineState=false` query parameter on resume execution to disable auto saving engine state, not sure why you would do that? but it's a boolean so it seems fair...

- take `autosaveEngineState` query parameter on resume execution to enable auto saving engine state

## [0.8.0] - 2024-10-26
